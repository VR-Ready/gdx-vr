libGDX Virtual Reality Extension
================================

This extension is currently a WIP (Work In Progress). Do not try to use it yet.

In the future it will support different head mounted displays and offer a cross-platform interface.

It is planned to support the [Oculus](http://www.oculus.com/) and [Cardboard](https://cardboard.withgoogle.com/).
